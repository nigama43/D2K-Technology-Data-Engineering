# D2K Technology Data Engineering Assignments

Welcome to the D2K Technology Data Engineering Assignments repository. This repository contains assignments related to loading, transforming, and ingesting data, along with writing SQL queries for visualization.



## Project Overview

In this project, we focus on:

- Loading data from various sources
- Transforming data to make it suitable for analysis
- Ingesting data into a database
- Writing SQL queries to visualize data trends and insights


Assignments
Data Loading
In this section, we focus on loading data from different sources, such as CSV files, APIs, and databases. The scripts for data loading are located in the data_loading directory.

Data Transformation
Here, we transform the loaded data to clean and structure it appropriately for analysis. Transformation scripts can be found in the data_transformation directory.

Data Ingestion
This section covers ingesting the transformed data into a database for further analysis. The ingestion scripts are available in the data_ingestion directory.

SQL Queries for Visualization
We write SQL queries to analyze the ingested data and create visualizations. These queries are located in the sql_queries directory.
